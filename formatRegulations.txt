     </li>
     <li>

     </li>

   <li>
    Strike System
    <ul>
     <li>

      <ul>
       <li>
        The Librarian will attempt to contact the member in question, explaining the consequences of the "strike", along with the date the resource(s) needs to be returned by.
       </li>
       <li>
        If the resource(s) has not been returned within two days after this contact, the borrower will receive another strike at each following Committee meeting until the resource(s) is returned.
       </li>
       <li>
        Upon reaching three "strikes", the member in question will have their long-term borrowing privileges revoked.
       </li>
       <li>
        All "strikes" will be removed and all borrowing privileges reinstated at Semester 1 O-Day and the start of Semester 2.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  The treasurer (or a committee member acting on their instruction) may spend up to $600 on consumables (such as food, stationary, or cleaning products) without consulting the committee. These purchases may still be subject to review by committee.
 </li>
 <li>
  The treasurer (or a committee member acting on their instruction) may spend up to $400 on Magic: the Gathering products without consulting the committee. These purchases may still be subject to review by committee.
 </li>
 <li>
  After emptying the bin or recycling bin outside the Unigames club room, or the bin in the loft, a club member may be awarded a free consumable worth up to 80¢ from the club.
  <ul>
   <li>
    The responsible gatekeeper is neither obligated to award a consumable (for instance, in the case of the bin being emptied when it was already nearly empty,) nor barred from awarding themselves or other gatekeepers consumables – though in such a case they still have to have actually emptied the bin.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  The three keys to each of the padlocks on the wall box and lock box shall be distributed as follows: One copy of each key shall be kept by the President and Treasurer each, and one copy of each key shall remain in the combination key box.
  <ul>
   <li>
    In the event that any of the above keys are misplaced, it shall be the responsibility of that key's custodian to replace the respective lock(s).
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  The key to the room may not be carried on persons for extended periods of time prior to 5PM. It should be extracted from the club cupboard only for the immediate purpose of opening something, and returned immediately after this. After 5PM and until 8AM the following day it is permissible for a gatekeeper to carry the keys to the clubroom on their person provided they remain within the upper floor of Cameron Hall. The keys must be returned to the cupboard by the time that the last gatekeeper leaves Cameron Hall.
 </li>
 <li>

 </li>
 <li>
  Splat Rule:
  <ul>
   <li>
    Unigames will cover half the cost of any game resources (such as 'splat' books or board games) when a member or group of members pledges the other half, subject to a committee vote.
    <ul>
     <li>
      The purchased resources will belong to Unigames.
     </li>
     <li>
      This regulation is intended to supply things such as non-core RPG texts for club members to use.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  If a person donates a resource or pledges money (for example, via the 'Splat Rule') towards the purchase of a book, then it shall be recorded as such inside the resource.
 </li>
 <li>
  Unigames will cover the cost of a one-day pass to SwanCon so that the Librarian or their delegate may research and trial resources for the club.
 </li>
 <li>
  The treasurer will add funds to the club's Uniprint account when it has less than $10.
 </li>
 <li>
  Unigames committee members and gatekeepers can remove and ban, or 'door' individuals from the club room for a length of time decided by them and based on the severity of the situation.
  <ul>
   <li>
    This banning also prevents the banned individual from attending Unigames events, regardless of the event's location.
   </li>
   <li>
    The maximum length of time that an individual can be banned is until the next committee meeting or general meeting, at which point the banning will be reviewed and either continued or lifted.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  During or immediately after a food run the treasurer, or the individual who owns the car being driven to facilitate the food run, may claim a consumable for themselves as payment in lieu of 'petrol money'.
  <ul>
   <li>
    This consumable shall not be worth more than $3.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  The club room may be left unsupervised by a gatekeeper in some circumstances.
  <ul>
   <li>
    This can only be done if all three of the following conditions are true:
    <ul>
     <li>
      There are other people in the club room, who have been instructed to not touch the money box and have been informed of the situation.
     </li>
     <li>
      The money box is visible to the webcams.
     </li>
     <li>
      The gatekeeper in question is going to the bathroom, searching Cameron Hall for another gatekeeper, or taking some other task that will take no more than two minutes.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    In all other scenarios, all people should be removed from the clubroom and it should be locked.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
